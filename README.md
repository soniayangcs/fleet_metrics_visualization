Flight Data Metrics Report

•	dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/traceyvanp/airlinefleet

One specific axis I examined the data on that was not mentioned in the dataset specifically but was a point of personal interest for me was Low Cost vs. Traditional carriers. Customers are always trying to save money no matter what service they purchase and there is a growing demand for low cost carriers where customers are willing to sacrifice comfort or amenities for a lower price plane ticket.
I created an extra column in the data called carrier type and used this comprehensive list for reference to mark which airlines are low cost ones and marked the rest as traditional.

Summary of findings
* US-based airlines have the largest fleets; China is not far behind
* Low-cost airlines from Asia have the fastest growth 
•	Low-cost airlines do not try to save money by buying cheaper planes
•	Boeing 747 and Airbus A320 are the most popular planes, the latter even more so with low-cost airlines
•	US-based and China-based airlines do not have the highest fleet longevity
•	Fleet age is not a major deciding factor in ordering new planes
